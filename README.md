# XML parsing with Javascript

Built XML parser using Javascript as part of Web Technologies course assignment during Fall 2015 at USC. The parser takes data from the XML file URL entered by the user and renders it in a table with appropriate headings for all the tags.

All edge cases like file not found on the server, no input, invalid XML schema, no data inside the XML file etc have been handled as well.
